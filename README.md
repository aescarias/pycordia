If you have any questions, feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/h5JhXtGfXQ) to follow the changes we make, as well as receive help and talk with others!

Our examples, and documentation assume you're at a level of Python where you can comfortably work with Discord bots.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Pycordia has been well tested on Python 3.8, however, 3.7 and above are supported.

### Installing from PIP

The easiest way to get Pycordia on your system is by installing it through `pip`.

```sh
$ pip install pycordia               # Should work everywhere
$ pip3 install pycordia              # Should work on most *nix systems; use on MacOS
$ python -m pip install pycordia     # Alternative; should work everywhere
$ python3 -m pip install pycordia    # Alternative; use on MacOS
$ py -3 -m pip install pycordia      # Alternative; use on Windows
```

## üèì Example of a simple Ping-Pong Bot

```py
from pycordia import events, models
import pycordia
import dotenv
import os

dotenv.load_dotenv()
client = pycordia.Client(intents=pycordia.Intents.all())

@client.event
async def on_ready(event: events.ReadyEvent):
    print(f"{event.user} ready to do stuff!", client.intents)

@client.event
async def on_message_create(msg: models.Message):
    if msg.author.bot or not msg.content:
        return

    if msg.content.startswith(".ping"):
        embed = models.Embed.create(description=":ping_pong: Pong!")
        embed.color = 0xFF123A

        await models.Message.send(msg.channel_id, embeds=[embed])

client.run(os.getenv("DISCORD_TOKEN"))
```

## Events

- `on_ready`: `events.ReadyEvent`
- `on_message_create`: `models.Message`
- `on_typing_start`: `events.TypingStartEvent`
- `on_message_delete`, `on_message_delete_bulk`: `events.MessageDeleteEvent`
- `on_message_update`: `models.Message`
- `on_channel_create`, `on_channel_update`, `on_channel_delete`: `models.Channel`

For all other undocumented events, you'll receive raw JSON data which you'll have to handle yourself.

## üîñ Things to do

- Improve currently available models
- Add slash commands
- Add all other event wrappers

## üìñ Contribute

Feel free to contribute any bug fixes, new features, or general improvements to the Pycordia project.
